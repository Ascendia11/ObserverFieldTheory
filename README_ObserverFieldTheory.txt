# Observer Field Theory  
## A Unified Informational Framework for the Emergence of Reality  
**Version 1 – Original Formalization by Thomas Tai Dinh Pham**  
**Date:** March 22–23, 2025  
**Release Type:** Conceptual Framework V1 (Protected Release)

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains the official Version 1 archive of **Observer Field Theory**, a conceptual framework unifying Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity through observer–informational interactions.

The theory proposes that reality emerges from the interaction between the observer and a **Universal Informational Field (UIF)** — formalized using Hilbert space theory, observer-defined operators, and expectation values. Early numeric simulations suggest that observer precision influences measurable physical outcomes.
